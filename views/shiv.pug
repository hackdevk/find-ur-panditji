        p Shiva ( Sanskrit: शिव, Śiva, lit. the auspicious one) also known as Mahadeva ( the greatest god) is one of the principal deities of Hinduism. He is the supreme being within Shaivism, one of the major traditions within contemporary Hinduism. Shiva is known as "The Destroyer" within the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity that includes Brahma  and Vishnu. In Shaivism tradition, Shiva is the supreme being who creates, protects and transforms the universe. In the tradition of Hinduism called Shaktism, the Goddess, or Devi, is described as supreme, yet Shiva is revered along with Vishnu and Brahma.

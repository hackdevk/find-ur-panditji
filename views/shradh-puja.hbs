                            Tarpan : ‘Trup’ means satisfying others. The word ‘Tarpan’ has been formed from the root word
                             ‘Trup’. Offering water to God, Sages, ancestors’ soul and human beings and satisfying them
                              through it is called tarpan.

                            Posture of hand while offering Tarpana  The posture of hand while offering Tarpana varies for
                             offerings made to devas (Gods, Goddesses and Navagrahas), rishis (sages) and pitrus (departed ancestors).
                            <br>(a) For devas, the offering is made to flow over the four fingers of the right hand other than the thumb.
                            <br>(b) For rishis, the offering is made to flow on the area of the left side of the right palm between the wrist and the little finger.
                            <br>(c) For the pitrus, the offering is made to flow over the right side of the right palm and the thumb of the right hand.
                            <br>
                            for offering Tarpana 
                            It is believed that one’s pitrus will be eagerly awaiting for tarpana on all the above-mentioned
                             occasions. If no offering is made, they will return to their places disappointed, and the descendant
                              misses their blessings which he would have received, if he had performed his filial duties.
